                  <div class="abstract">
                    <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                    Merge conflicts often occur when developers change the same code
artifacts. Such conflicts might be frequent in practice, and resolving
them might be costly and is an error-prone activity. To minimize these problems by
reducing merge conflicts, it is important to better understand how
conflict occurrence is affected by technical and organizational factors. With that aim, we investigate seven factors related to three different aspects
of developers contributions: modularity, size, and timing. 
We evaluate the factors effect on the following variables: conflict
occurrence, number of conflicts, and number of files with conflicts. By analyzing 20449 merge scenarios from 101 Ruby and 25 Python MVC projects in 
GitHub, we find evidence that the likelihood of merge conflict occurrence significantly
increases when contributions to be merged are not modular in the sense that they 
involve files from the same MVC slice (related model, view, and controller files). 
We also find that bigger contributions involving more developers, commits, changed 
files, or changed code lines (except for Python) more likely lead to merge conflicts. 
With respect to the timing factors, we observe that contributions developed over longer 
periods of time more likely lead to conflicts. Contrasting, our sample reveals that the conclusion delay between merged 
contributions has no effect on merge conflict occurrence. No evaluated
factor shows predictive power concerning both the number of merge
conflicts and the number of files with conflicts. Based on our findings, to avoid merge conflicts in the context of MVC projects, 
managers should consider aligning the structure of development tasks with the structure 
of the associated application MVC slices, and avoid the parallel execution of tasks
that focus on common slices. Our results could also be used to derive merge conflict prediction models. 
Project management and assistive tools could benefit from these models by 
supporting earlier decisions about when to integrate contributions to 
mitigate or reduce conflicts.

                    <h4>Study Setup</h4>
                    <p>To perform this study, we analyze a number of merge scenarios, collecting data about the mentioned conflict factors, and reproducing the merge operation in each scenario to observe conflict occurrence, number of conflicts, and number of files with conflicts. To support that, we implement the infrastructure illustrated in Figure 1, which involves two steps. The first focuses on mining merge scenarios from GitHub projects, reproducing them, and collecting information about the dependent variables. The second collects, for each scenario, information about the conflict factors, and explores regression models to assess the factors effect on these variables.</p>
